                For nearly two years now, the Foundation has been providing midday meals to the economically disadvantaged pupils of Gayaram Sishu Siksha Niketan, located close to Garden High School. The number of pupils attending that school has almost doubled during this period, from around 25 to about 50. Besides midday meals, the Foundation has also presented new clothes to the children before the Pujas, distributed study material amongst them, and arranged for some entertainment for them on Children's Day. The experience has been a very satisfying one for all concerned. The Foundation now earnestly desires to extend this scheme and provide midday meals to the pupils of another school of the neighbourhood, but it needs your help, for its limited resources cannot be stretched any further.
                <br /><br />
                It is estimated that to provide a good, nutritious meal to 50 children, it costs about `2000. We appeal to everyone to become a sponsor of at least one meal. The meal may be offered to mark a special occasion, like a birthday, or in remembrance of a beloved or venerated person. The sponsor and the members of his/her family would be most welcome to be present on the day this meal is served to the children. Their presence would assure the children that there are people who do care for them.
                <br /><br />
                All donations to the Foundation are exempt under section 80G of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
