                Satikanta Guha Foundation was established in September 1991 in memory of Satikanta Guha who expired in January that year.<br /><br />

Since the names of Satikanta Guha and his wife, Prity Lata Guha, the first secretary of the Foundation are indissolubly linked with South Point as its Founder and Associate Founder, the first members of the Foundation decided that education should be the main sphere of the Foundation's activities.
<br /><br />
In pursuance of that aim, the Foundation was rendering since its inception substantial financial assistance to various centers of learning, educational institutions, and needy and meritorious students. However, it was increasingly felt that the Foundation should be more directly and actively involved in promoting education by establishing a school. That would indeed be the best way to honour the man whose name it bears and to commemorate his contribution to the cause of education. The project of setting up a secondary and higher secondary school was thus undertaken in 1999, and thus Garden High School was born.
